Binance BUY-SAT Bot EN Hello, I have prepared a Binance BUY-SELL Bot made with Python for you.

Making money with this bot depends on the success of the strategy used. Factors such as the correct strategy,
setting the appropriate parameters, quick response to changes in the market, and risk management can help you achieve a successful result.
However, no strategy can deliver certain returns, and the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and risky, so it's important to be careful and 
manage risks when trading with any trading bot. I do not accept any responsibility.
When using this bot, you hope that you will use it for your personal interests. Any loss of money is not my responsibility.

Usage 
1- Enter your Binance API Key and Binance API Secret in the api-keys.json file. 
2- In the Coin section, write the coin representation you want to trade.
3- You can set your price with buy_price to buy coins at the price you want from the Binancebot.py file. 
4- To sell, enter the price you want to sell with sell_price. 
5- This bot runs in an infinite loop and will continue to run unless programmed to stop.
